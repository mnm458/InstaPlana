Bug Fixes
* Administration: improvements to admin form controls height and alignment standardization (see related dev note), dashboard widget links accessibility and alternate color scheme readability issues (see related dev note).
* Block editor: fix Edge scrolling issues and intermittent JavaScript issues.
* Bundled themes: add customizer option to show/hide author bio, replace JS based smooth scroll with CSS (see related dev note) and fix Instagram embed CSS.
* Date/time: improve non-GMT dates calculation, fix date format output in specific languages and make get_permalink() more resilient against PHP timezone changes.
* Embeds: remove CollegeHumor oEmbed provider as the service doesnâ€™t exist anymore.
* External libraries: update sodium_compat.
* Site health: allow the remind interval for the admin email verification to be filtered.
* Uploads: avoid thumbnails overwriting other uploads when filename matches, and exclude PNG images from scaling after upload.
* Users: ensure administration email verification uses the user's locale instead of the site locale.
