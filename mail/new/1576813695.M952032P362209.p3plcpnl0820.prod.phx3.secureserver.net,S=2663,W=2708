Bug Fixes
* Date/Time: Ensure that get_feed_build_date() correctly handles a modified post object with invalid date.
* Uploads: Fix file name collision in wp_unique_filename() when uploading a file with upper case extension on non case-sensitive file systems.
* Media: Fix PHP warnings in wp_unique_filename() when the destination directory is unreadable.
* Administration: Fix the colors in all color schemes for buttons with the .active class.
* Posts, Post Types: In wp_insert_post(), when checking the post date to set future or publish status, use a proper delta comparison.

Login to your web hosting control panel and navigate to the Installatron tool to update your installed applications.
